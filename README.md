slim-de-selector
----------------

Script slim-de-selector switches graphical environment to another chosen from a zenity menu.


PREMISE/PURPOSE

Slim does let the user choose a graphical environment by pressing "F1", but there is no way of sorting the available environments, which the author of this script finds annoying. The sole purpose of this script is to abate this annoyance/nuisance.


USAGE

Click slim-de-selector icon in you menu.

It is also possible to use slim-de-selector from the command line:

	slim-de-selector [ DE ]

DE is optional. When used without DE, the script dispays a manu to choose from.
Used with DE, the script just switched to the chosen DE.


INSTALLATION

No special installation. Just put the slim-de-selector.desktop file... Figure it yourself.


DEPENDENCIES/CONFLICTS
- zenity
- Your DE needs to start through .xinit

No conflicts.


FURTHER DEVELOPMENT
- No further development.
- Some minor improvements possible, but not likely.
